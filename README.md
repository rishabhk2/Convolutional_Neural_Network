# Convolutional neural network is generally used for image classification problems. CNN is a supervised machine learning algorithm which means we pass labels along with the features. The CNN tries to learn the image(with label) so that it develops the ability to predict the similar image in future. The same/similar images is provided to the CNN multiple times for the better understanding and good prediction ability. For instance if a dataset has 40,000 images and all the 40,000 images are passed to the CNN again and again, here in this paper we will be using Cifer 10 dataset which has 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. A validation set is fetched from the training images which contains 10,000 images.
